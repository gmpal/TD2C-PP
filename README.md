## Abstract

Discovering causal relationships in complex multivariate time series is a fundamental scientific challenge. Traditional methods often falter, either by relying on restrictive linear assumptions or on conditional independence tests that become uninformative in the presence of intricate, non-linear dynamics. This paper proposes a new paradigm, shifting from statistical testing to pattern recognition. We hypothesize that a causal link creates a persistent and learnable asymmetry in the flow of information through a system's temporal graph, even when clear conditional independencies are obscured. We introduce Temporal Dependency to Causality (TD2C), a supervised learning framework that operationalizes this hypothesis. TD2C learns to recognize these complex causal signatures from a rich set of information-theoretic and statistical descriptors. Trained exclusively on a diverse collection of synthetic time series, TD2C demonstrates remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen dynamics and established, realistic benchmarks. Our results show that TD2C achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming established methods, particularly in high-dimensional and non-linear settings. By reframing the discovery problem, our work provides a robust and scalable new tool for uncovering causal structures in complex systems.

## Key Highlights
- **Novel Supervised Framework**: Introduces TD2C, a new supervised learning framework for robust time series causal discovery.
- **Asymmetric Information Flow**: Models causality as a learnable, asymmetric signature in the flow of information, moving beyond simple independence tests.
- **Zero-Shot Generalization**: Generalizes from diverse synthetic data to complex benchmarks (NetSim, DREAM3) without retraining or fine-tuning.
- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Achieves SOTA performance, showing significant advantages in high-dimensional and non-linear systems.

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gmpal/IJF-TD2C.git
cd IJF-TD2C
```

### 2. Download and Set Up the Data Folder
The `data` directory, which contains all datasets, pre-computed features, and cached results, is approximately 500MB and is not stored in this Git repository. You must download it separately to reproduce the analysis without re-running the most computationally expensive steps.

**[>> Download the `data.zip` file here <<](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z8cHkUTe7TlvWwqBlpoEsukWaSsvFC26/view?usp=sharing)** 

Once downloaded, unzip the file and place the resulting `data` folder in the root of the repository:
```bash
# After downloading data.zip to the repository root...
unzip data.zip

# Verify the structure: the 'data' folder should now be in your current directory
ls
# Expected output includes: data/  reproduce/  src/  results/  README.md ...
```

### 3. Set Up the Conda Environment
We strongly recommend using `conda` to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Create a new conda environment with Python 3.8
conda create -n td2c python=3.8 -y

# Activate the environment
conda activate td2c

# Install the required packages using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Your environment is now ready.

## Reproducing the Paper's Results
The `reproduce/py_scripts/` directory contains numbered Python scripts that execute the entire experimental pipeline. We recommend running them in order.

**Note:** Steps 1, 2, and 4 are computationally intensive. The provided `data` folder contains pre-computed results, allowing you to **skip these steps** and proceed directly to the analysis (Step 5 and onward) if you wish.

### Step 1: Generate Synthetic Data

```

### Step 4: Run Main Benchmarks
Trains the final TD2C classifier and runs the full benchmark against all competitor methods on all test sets.
*   **Output:** `data/causal_dfs/` and `data/before_d2c/`
```bash
python reproduce/py_scripts/04_run_benchmarks.py
```

### Step 5: Analyze Synthetic Data Results
